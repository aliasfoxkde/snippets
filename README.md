Python Code Snippets Created while Learning

I use this repository as a template for many of my little projects, academic in
nature.

All files found here can be used for your own learning and/or development and is
provided AS-IS without warranty of any kind. That being said, feel free to modify 
the code as you see fit for your own purpose, academically or financially (if at 
all useful in that way).

Best!
