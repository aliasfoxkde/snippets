When I began down the road of learning python, I encountered a special "secret" invitation 
called the Google FooBar Challenge. When reaserching more advanced Python concepts, my
google search results split and animated into a scewed page of results an a message
reading "You're speaking our language. Up for a Challenge?" with the options "I want to play",
"No Thanks", or "Don't show me this again". I was actually moving too quickly the first time
through pages as I do and missed it the first time. But the message appeared again and I
accepted the challenge. It actually appeared one more time for me later on, so I signed
up with a second email acount of mine.
