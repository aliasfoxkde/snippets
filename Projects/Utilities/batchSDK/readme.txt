Batch SDK (Script Development Kit) v0.0.01

Mission:
The purpose of this Batch IDK is to be used as a general purpose development tool 
for creating "advanced" aplications using only the Batch Programming Language.

Usage:
Usually, doing anything more than basic scripting using cascading logic (top
to bottom without use of "functions") is too complicated for Batch. Also, it's
often not practical due to having to "reuse" code. However, with certain tricks
these are features that can be extended to the Batch scripting "language".

FAQ:

Q: But why?
A: You might be asking yourself, why on Earth would you create a script development
   kit built in batch, what is the point? The answer is just because you can, and
   because most people don't think, or know you can. Even advanced users of Batch
   aren't aware that you can write re-usable and structured code using batch. 
   But YOU CAN! and so I/WE DID!

Thanks!
