""" Pseudo Compression Algorithm """

This is experimental code that exploits a potential side effect of compression 
libraries. This is not intended to be a "real world" compression algorithm. 
Zippy is an amazing compression technique but it can only reduce "pattern" 
data and not random datasets.
